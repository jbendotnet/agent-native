# Deployment, release, and publish recovery

Use this guide for each `review-latest-feedback` sweep, even when no report
links a failed run.

## Scan and classify

- Inspect recent deploy, release, desktop build/sign/notarize/update, and
  package-publish runs since the previous deployment cursor; on the first run,
  use the last 7 days for completed-run history and independently include every
  nonterminal run regardless of age. Seed the carried-run list with all active
  runs before advancing the cursor. Include queued, approval-waiting, and
  running jobs, and recheck them regardless of age. Finish all result pages
  before advancing the cursor. Cover app/template beta, docs, and production
  lanes where configured. Use current workflow/target maps and provider or
  registry state.
- Check deployed app revisions, desktop release assets, and package versions
  for missing or stale artifacts, including when a workflow reports success.
- For each failure or target mismatch, inspect authoritative logs. Record the
  run URL, workflow, failed job/step, target/platform/package/version, source
  SHA, and error in the ledger.
- Separate repo-owned source/workflow/config defects from provider errors,
  skipped or manual gates, cancellations, and superseded runs. Fix confirmed
  repo-owned causes at their owning boundary. Record an external owner and exact
  next action when the cause is outside the repo.

## Recover and verify

Use the lane's normal workflow and the invocation's applicable publish/deploy
authority. Recover only affected lanes. Read `ship` for PR/push/merge work and
`ship-and-monitor` for beta, docs, release-tail, or manual-production proof.
If a required release action is not authorized, keep its operational row active
with the exact next action.

Verify the intended source and delivery artifact at the target:

- **Apps:** confirm the target has the intended revision and smoke-test the
  affected URL or health path, including cache behavior when relevant.
- **Desktop:** confirm the expected version and platform assets exist, then
  exercise the affected install or update path through launch.
- **Packages:** confirm the exact version is in the registry and install or
  scaffold it from a clean cache. For npx, record pinned/filed versions, remove
  local overrides, verify the candidate and published release, and check the
  existing-app upgrade path (for example, `pnpm add
@agent-native/core@<version>` or the documented hand edit).

A green workflow, merged source, beta promise, or local scaffold alone does not
prove delivery. Keep carrying each operational row and nonterminal run ID until
the intended artifact is present and its target check passes; a linked source issue can be **Fixed**
while the operational row remains open. Run-only failures get a ledger row, not
a fabricated Slack reaction. Local proof is not **Shipped**/**Live verified**
until the relevant artifact is published and its delivery/runtime bar passes.
Link the merge, release, verification, and any bump/re-scaffold follow-up.
