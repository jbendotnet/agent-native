# Review Latest Feedback

Four phases, in order. Phase 0 comes before any investigation, not after.

0. **Gate, then claim** every eligible item you intend to tackle with `👀`,
   before investigating any of it.
1. **Answer the people who answered you.** Older open questions first.
2. **Fix** what the evidence actually proves, at the owning boundary.
3. **Reply**, under a hard question budget, then recap.

Output is fixes. Reply in-thread for every workflow reaction added this run;
continuing work gets a concrete progress reply, and resolved work gets a final
reply after verification. Follow
[`slack-reaction-replies.md`](references/slack-reaction-replies.md).

## Slack channels

Default channels: `#product-agent-native-feedback` (`C0ATH3CCZT4`),
`#qa-agent-native` (`C0C4U4XRT6X`), and
`#dev-agent-native-feedback` (`C0AJ5QV0J03`). Apply the full workflow to each:
use its `in:<#CHANNEL>` filter for searches and read each channel. Track
pagination, reply cursors, and counts separately. Honor narrower invocation
scope. Each channel uses the same five-day scan boundary; `#dev-agent-native-feedback`
is a default input, not a special-case exclusion.

## Slack ownership gate

Before reading Slack, inspect message and parent reactions. Skip checkmarks and
`👀` owned by another task, including replies and linked work. Only the active
task named in status may resume its own `👀`: verify ownership, reread thread
and reactions, then continue only its scope. Handoffs require the current
owner's explicit reply naming the new task and scope. Claims never expire. Ask
Steve if ownership is unclear; stop if another mark appears. For continuing
work, post one status reply with task link and remaining scope.

## Phase 0: claim what you are taking

Resolve known duplicate clusters before claiming. For an eligible item, add
`👀` before investigation and never remove it. Do not resume items excluded by
the Slack ownership gate. Post **In progress** only when work continues beyond
this run.

**Defects are in scope: fix them or ask for the one detail needed to fix them.**
Investigate first; ask what they saw or did in plain language. Gather request
details and logs yourself; don't send reporters to developer tools.

The proposed remedy may be wrong while the bug is real. Trace the failure to
its owning boundary; do not reject it because the suggestion is unsuitable.

Record each symptom's disposition; subjective or out-of-scope feedback
doesn't close a separate defect. Tie each reaction to the scope it marks.

### Reaction gate

`👀` is claim history; `✅` requires **Fixed** after Phase 2 bars. Check each
reported symptom separately. For partial fixes, pair `✅` for verified scope
with `🎫` for any distinct unfinished scope that needs a human to take
ownership or act, whether or not a ticket exists. Link a verified ticket and
name its owner/action; without one, keep the handoff explicit in the reply and
ledger and say that an owner or ticket still needs to be assigned. Do not
create or promise a ticket without authorization. No `🎫` for fixed scope,
routine rollout, optional checks, subjective/out-of-scope, or unapproved work.
**Shipped**/**Live verified** alone don't earn `✅`. Never remove reactions.
Follow the reply reference before marking an item replied.

For every concrete objective defect, attempt to reproduce it before recording
an evidence limit or asking the reporter for more information. A screenshot,
error message, URL, or visible flow is enough to start tracing its owner; don't
wait for details that would not change the reproduction attempt. Phase 2's
local reproduction procedure applies to all defect reports, not only bashes.

If no safe repo-owned fix is evident after that attempt, record the specific
evidence limit. Ask only a question whose answer could change the reproduction
or unblock a fix; after four days without an answer, record **Abandoned - no
answer in 4 days**.

Use **Skipped** only for non-defects, never breakage. **Open - no question**
means you found neither a fix nor a useful question; state why in the thread.

### Authoritative disposition vocabulary

For eligible items, use one disposition per row; record it in the recap and, if
unstated, in the thread or linked work. Do not inspect gated items for status.
For clusters, post one owner status with each source permalink and
**Clustered**; do not mark duplicate non-owners separately. Give a distinct
question or update its own reaction and reply.

- **Terminal (keep this workflow's eye):** **Fixed**, **Shipped**, **Live
  verified**, **Open - no question**, **Resolved elsewhere**, **Skipped**,
  **Clustered**, or **Abandoned - no answer in 4 days**. Apply the reaction
  gate above.
- **Active (retain 👀):** **Verified locally**, **Built - live unverified**,
  **Deployed - live unverified**, **Not reproducible - attempted**, or
  **In progress**.
- **Waiting on reporter (retain 👀):** **Asked**, **Clarification needed**, or
  **Blocked on reporter**. Find these through Phase 1's question search.
- **Owned elsewhere:** use only for an unmarked item when accessible evidence
  confirms an active owner; marks owned by another task are skipped by the
  ownership gate.

After merge, mark **Fixed** when the source fix is verified. Track
release/runtime separately; normal rollout and optional live checks neither
reopen it nor warrant `🎫`. Follow up only on accepted work outside this run;
record source, target, owner, exact action, and verification. Don't reopen
closed fixes.
**Clustered** closes one row but retains it.

Enumerate channel parents newest backward through `next_cursor` until older
than 5 days. Check reactions first; skip marked messages.

**`slack_search` can rank and truncate.** Use channel reads to enumerate parents
and put their count in the recap. Sort targeted searches oldest-first and follow
`next_cursor` until exhausted.

Search hits are often replies; resolve `thread_ts` and check parent reactions
before reading the hit or opening the thread.

Read back each new `👀` once. Resume only through the verified owner or handoff
above; never resume checkmarked items.

Claiming does not investigate. Read back new claims. Do not claim out-of-scope
items. If a current-run claim proves out of scope, keep `👀` and post **Skipped**
once without a question. New evidence or upvotes never override the ownership
gate.

Record eligible claims and dispositions; report gated skips in aggregate only.
Cluster fresh repeats for Phase 2.

### External trackers are evidence, not status

For a supplied spreadsheet, export, test matrix, or tracker, read metadata then
the bounded range with its named connector. Enumerate every row and its
completion status; retain its id, reporter, symptom, status, retest, and source
link.

Status, reactions, a merged PR, a source diff, or a unit test is not behavior
proof. Each row needs a post-change ledger result. If it cannot be read, say
**tracker unavailable**, never "no matches."

## Phase 1: answer the people who answered you

Answer eligible questions first; the ownership gate excludes prior-run marked
questions, even if a reporter has since replied.

Slack is the ledger; a per-run state file cannot carry state across runs. First,
exhaust this search to enumerate prior questions and context:

```
slack_search: "this was sent from a bot." in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=asc include_context=true max_context_length=300
```

Keep context and exhaust pages; include human replies regardless of
punctuation. Open only eligible threads with a human reply.

**The parent is the permalink's `thread_ts`.** `Message_ts` is your own
reply's timestamp; acting on it targets the wrong message.

Find replies even when their parent is older than the five-day scan. Read this
channel's prior reply-scan cursor; without one, scan all available history. A
new reply can belong to an old disclosure, so search all channel messages over
an overlapping date window instead of cursor-filtering the disclosure search:

```
slack_search: in:<#CHANNEL> after:<YYYY-MM-DD>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=asc
```

Filter hits by their timestamp, resolve parent `thread_ts`, and check reactions
first. Skip marked parents without opening threads. Never filter by the older
parent timestamp; `after:` is date-only, so start a day earlier and exhaust
pages. Advance the cursor to the greatest processed hit.

Count a question answered only when a person posts after it without this
workflow's disclosure marker; read the thread to reject partial, unrelated, or
deferred replies. Count each answer once; only a newer message reopens it.
Enumerate answered threads before new work and recap the count. Keep unanswered
**Clarification needed** pending until answered, resolved, or four days old;
other dispositions do not substitute. Reapply Phase 0 eye/checkmark rules.

Apply the age branches only to unanswered **Clarification needed** threads;
restore any such thread mistakenly marked **Open - no question**.

- **Someone answered** → highest priority in the run, ahead of every newer
  report: the evidence you said blocked you now exists. Rebuild it and attempt
  the fix. Reply **Fixed** only after all four bars pass; otherwise keep the
  clarification open. Never ask a follow-up before trying the fix.
  An answer that the issue is already resolved, fixed elsewhere, or not ours —
  a linked PR, "not a Clips issue" — is still an answer. Close it as
  **Resolved elsewhere** (terminal, and distinct from **Skipped**, which means
  out of scope): keep our `👀` and record who resolved it and where. The
  participant's reply is the status; do not add `✅`.
- **No answer, posted under 4 days ago** → leave it. Post nothing. A second
  message is a nag, not a follow-up.
- **No answer, posted over 4 days ago** → the question failed. Do not remind or
  re-ask. Keep the `👀`, record **Abandoned - no answer in 4 days** once in the
  thread without a new question, and carry any still-relevant bug forward as an
  internal investigation.

Search without `after`, then apply the four-day expiry; disclosure is the
cross-identity cursor. For legacy replies without disclosure or eyes, run once
per valid workflow identity:

```
slack_search: from:<EACH_WORKFLOW_IDENTITY> in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=asc
```

Classify these hits by clarification wording (for example, `if you can share`),
not as the discovery cursor. Inspect author and full thread; never re-ask a
result from either search. Search the disclosure string, not a display name,
and include it in every reply.

## Classification rules

Phase 0 applies these from parent-level evidence to decide what to claim.
Phase 2 reapplies these rules after full-thread review.

Use `## Slack channels` unless the invocation narrows scope.

**Automated diagnostics are feedback.** For Slack, gate before reading.
Before claiming, use only alert/link metadata. Follow
[`automated-diagnostics.md`](references/automated-diagnostics.md) for ownership,
claim, and stop/continue; inspect logs, tests, and artifacts only afterward.

**Defects and design feedback.** A clear bug has observable broken behavior: a
click or submit does nothing, an action errors, data is lost or reverted, the
result is wrong, or a working flow regressed. A credible "nothing happens" is
valid evidence — inspect the owning path before doubting the reporter.

Do not change code for an unrelated product idea, praise, status update, merge
or review request, irrelevant bot forward, duplicate, or work outside the
invocation's ownership.

**Subjective UX proposals need human review.** Adding buttons/chrome or changing
visibility, placement, emphasis, or discoverability (including “hard to find”)
is a product proposal, not a defect. Check overflow, keyboard, Cmd+K, and
contextual surfaces first. Recap the ask, findings, options, recommendation,
and tradeoff; mark **Skipped**. A report or `:upvote:` never authorizes automatic
implementation; only a user-directed task may implement an approved approach.
If claimed, keep 👀, post **Skipped** once, and don't ask the reporter to choose.

Auto-fix objective defects only: broken behavior/results, misalignment,
overlap/clipping, illegibility, unusable focus/targets, jank, jitter,
measurable slowness, regressions. Separate defects from preferences; measure
failures with `text-heavy-ui`. Content remains Alice's unless claimed.

### `:upvote:` authorizes feature requests

An `:upvote:` from **the invoking identity** - not from anyone else - promotes
an otherwise out-of-scope item into scope and authorizes the work. Subjective
UX proposals are the exception: an upvote routes them for human review, not
implementation by this sweep.

Find them alongside the newest-message scan:

```
slack_search: hasmy::upvote: in:<#CHANNEL>
```

`hasmy:` is already scoped to the connected identity you verified, so every
hit is an endorsement by definition. Hits are not self-evidently in scope —
the query also returns ordinary replies and old polls that happen to carry the
reaction. Take the ones that name a concrete improvement; skip the rest
without comment.

An upvote endorses an otherwise out-of-scope **feature request** and skips only
the clear-bug bar; it does not change ownership, reaction, verification, or
question-budget rules. Subjective UX proposals remain review-only as above.
Build the smallest eligible endorsed version, name Sid or Alice, and state
requested versus actual behavior in the recap. Add `👀` before investigation or
delegation and read it back. Keep it evidence-limited until Phase 2's four bars
hold; then use **Shipped**, adding `✅` only if it meets **Fixed**.

Don't search `has::eyes:`; use the owner or handoff path above.

For GitHub, Sentry, and first-party Agent-Native Analytics, use native state as
the cursor: recent open or unresolved items with no maintainer disposition,
deduplicated against Slack. If a source cannot be read, record it as
**unavailable**. Never report "nothing matched" for a source you could not
query.

<!-- framework-repo-only:start -->
### CI failures

Run `pnpm ci:red-report`; follow [CI triage](references/ci-red-report.md).
Keep each row in this transcript; never issue-track CI fingerprints.
Query failures mean **CI unavailable**, not empty. Deploy/release/publish rows
follow [`deployment-recovery.md`](references/deployment-recovery.md) and stay
active through target proof; track source-fix disposition separately.
<!-- framework-repo-only:end -->

### GitHub issues, Sentry, and Agent-Native Analytics are first-class feedback

Read each issue's body, comments, author, labels, linked PRs. Treat
prior `fixed`, `shipped`, or `merged` comments as leads; recheck the surface.
When a fix merges, record **Fixed** and link proof in the recap. Close a GitHub
issue only when this invocation explicitly authorizes it; otherwise record the
pending close. Track release/runtime gaps separately.

Before claiming an issue, check comments for handoffs. If someone offers a PR,
or Steve asks them to, mark **Owned elsewhere**; do not investigate, edit, test,
ship, reply, or close it. A direct request overrides this.

Fix every defect at its root or ask an unblock question; do not
skip old, bot-filed, or maintainer-commented issues. Feature requests and
subjective feedback need user/`:upvote:` authorization. Ask three questions max;
re-read before posting/closing.

Query both production Sentry projects - frontend/browser and backend/CLI -
paginate unresolved issues, and record representative events, releases, and
fingerprints. Classify each as repo-owned, external/provider,
deployment/configuration, or unclear. Fix repo-owned failures at the boundary
and verify locally. Use hosted runtime only when the full symptom cannot be
reproduced locally and hosted behavior is needed. Track release gaps separately;
don't hold a merged fix open. Record other external actions; silence or a stale
release doesn't prove the error is gone.

Query authenticated Agent-Native Analytics error issues in parallel. Use
`list-error-issues` for unresolved groups, then `get-error-issue` for stacks,
occurrences, breadcrumbs, tags, and replay links. It captures client exceptions
and server `captureError()` failures when the server Analytics key/provider is
configured. Use it as the Sentry fallback when rate-limited. Do not query
`error_issues` or `error_events` through
`query-agent-native-analytics`; use that action only for bounded event/LLM
correlation. Apply the same local-first rule. Fix worthwhile repo-owned failures
at their boundary; record external, deployment, or unclear issues without
inventing a fix.

### Deployment, release, and publish failures

Scan app/template, desktop, and package lanes every sweep, even without linked
feedback. Carry active run IDs, queued/running runs, failures, and missing/stale
artifacts across cursors. Fix repo causes; record external/manual causes with
the next owner/action. CI-red deploy rows from [CI triage](references/ci-red-report.md)
reuse this operational fingerprint. Follow
[`deployment-recovery.md`](references/deployment-recovery.md) for recovery and
target proof; keep delivery active until proof passes. A source issue may be
**Fixed** separately; delivery gaps are never **Quarantined**. Green CI or
merged source does not prove delivery.

## Phase 2: fix

Before changing code, read `fix-at-the-boundary`, `verifying-changes`, and
`concurrent-agents`. Read `ship` when a verified fix is ready to publish.

**Read the evidence the reporter already attached before forming a hypothesis.**
Open every screenshot, clip, and linked artifact. The error text in a
screenshot is usually the whole diagnosis. Track an artifact that is
permission-gated or expired separately from one that was never provided —
inaccessible is not absent.

### Attempt local reproduction before evidence-limiting

For each concrete objective defect, try the reported flow before deciding it
cannot be reproduced or fixed. Trace the screenshot, URL, visible action, and
error through the app to its route, action, provider, or form contract; use
those clues to choose the closest runnable local seam. Exercise the flow with
a local build and synthetic fixtures. If its external dependency is unavailable,
mock that boundary or submit the same shape to a local validator. Do not use a
reporter's real email or create a real external record merely to prove a
failure.

Record the route or action, build, fixture, steps, expected and actual result,
and error. Code inspection alone is not a reproduction attempt, and
**Not reproducible - attempted** requires an actual flow attempt. Ask the
reporter only when a specific missing detail would change the attempt or fix;
otherwise make the best local attempt with the evidence already available.
If the attempt stops at a concrete access or environment limit, name what was
tried and what exact behavior remains untested. Measure misses with
`feedback-no-local-repro`.

**Sweep siblings before you claim anything is fixed.** Derive the fingerprint
from the symptom, not the file — the exact crashing token, call shape, or
literal — then search the repo for it and enumerate every hit in your recap
before editing. `fix-at-the-boundary` owns the method. A fix that repairs the
reported route and leaves the identical crash in its sibling is not a fix, and
the reporter was told otherwise.

### Repeats get more time, not the same fix again

Before fixing anything, search the channel for prior reports of the same
symptom:

```
slack_search: <2-4 distinctive symptom words> in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=desc
```

Search in the reporter's words — `zoom invalid_client`, `logout twice` — not
your diagnosis. Read hits; one bug may have different descriptions.

**A repeat report after a Fixed claim is evidence that fix failed.** It is the
only falsification signal this workflow gets, and it outranks your belief that
the code is correct. Treat it as a stop, not a fresh report:

1. **Find what we said last time** — the prior thread, its **Fixed** reply,
   and the commit behind it. You want the claim that turned out wrong.
2. **Name why it did not take**: never deployed; fixed a sibling path; root
   cause misdiagnosed; or one symptom of several. Each needs a different
   repair, and re-applying the same class of change is how one bug ships
   three times.
3. **Reproduce end to end before editing, verify end to end after.** A passing
   unit test is not sufficient for a repeat — exercise the surface the reporter
   used. `verifying-changes` owns the proof.
4. **Cluster identical causes** into one investigation and fix, but keep a
   recap row per source thread; Phase 3's reply rules still apply.

Record `Repeat of: <link>` and the prior failed fix in each row; never call a
repeat fixed on the evidence that supported the earlier claim.

Measure this gate with friction keys `false-done` and
`repeat-report-refix`. Run `node scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs --weeks 2
--pattern <key>` for each before changing it and again later. A climbing count
requires a mechanical proof or release gate, not more prose.

### Reproduction and verification detail

Use [`reproduction-and-verification.md`](references/reproduction-and-verification.md)
for the bug-bash contract, reproduction ledger, and regression proof.

### Npx and package reports have a release follow-up

Use [`deployment-recovery.md`](references/deployment-recovery.md) for npx
version, registry, publication, and existing-app upgrade proof. A verified merge
may be **Fixed** while its delivery row stays open; a local scaffold or beta
promise is not delivery.

### Documentation has a runnable proof obligation

For each docs row, use [`documentation-proof.md`](references/documentation-proof.md).
A docs diff/build alone isn't proof.

Choose the narrowest seam the evidence supports:

- One isolated symptom → fix the owning local seam, add a regression check.
- Repeated or cross-surface symptoms → fix the shared primitive or contract.
- Missing capability or wrong tool → fix discovery, registry, or action wiring.
- Source-versus-live mismatch → diagnose build, deployment, or release state
  before changing source.

Never hard-code a rule for the wording of one report. One data point justifies
a local regression test or a contained fix; it never justifies a global agent
instruction or prompt exception.

## Phase 3: reply

Thank issue reporters for opening it and Slack reporters for sharing. Give the
status or ask a useful question. Follow `address-feedback-with-replies` for
Slack voice. End each Slack reply with `this was sent from a bot.` after its
plain-language status.

Short replies: say the change, limits, and next step. Link merged PRs and say
they're merged. Keep hashes, branches, CI, publisher, and run details in recap.
Beta fixes follow reference for timing and live status; state other availability
plainly.

Share only new or useful information.

### After a PR merges

Follow [`slack-reaction-replies.md`](references/slack-reaction-replies.md) for
post-merge beta ETAs and package replies.

For a fixed behavior with a ticketed handoff, state the done behavior and
remaining action/owner/ticket separately; don't imply the fixed scope is open.
Don't promise a ticket until created and assigned. Ask one targeted question if
needed. Do not reopen Slack in later runs to reply.

- **Fixed** / **Shipped** / **Live verified** meet Phase 2 bars. Recorded live
  observations may be silent; merged Slack fixes still get the reply above.
  **Shipped** is for upvoted improvements.
- **In progress** — name continuing work and its owner; ask nothing.
- **A question** — subject to the budget below.

Unclaimed scope/noise gets an internal recap row. Ask about an unverified defect
only when one answer would unblock it; otherwise record **Open - no question**
once. Cluster duplicates. Before re-reading any thread to reply, apply the Slack
ownership gate; stay out of marked messages and active human work.

### The question budget

**At most three questions per run, across all sources.** Most runs ask zero or
one.

So rank before you ask. For each candidate, state: *if I get this answer, I
can ship the fix.* Ask the three with the strongest answer. If fewer than
three clear that bar, ask fewer. Everything below the cut is an internal open
item, not a message.

Never ask for supplied/inspectable evidence, irrelevant IDs/build numbers,
subjective choices, or internal blockers. If a user-visible link or ID is the
sole blocker, ask plainly and say where to find it.

At most one clarification question may be pending per thread at a time. Once it
is answered or resolved, attempt the fix; if that exposes a different required
detail, ask at most one new, non-repeating question. Never stack questions or
repeat a pending one. If a needed artifact is inaccessible to you, ask for a
fresh link - not for its contents again.

## Verification and identity

Follow the `## Slack identity` contract in `address-feedback-with-replies`:
confirm the connected profile is the invoking user before the first write, and
keep that identity for every read, reaction, reply, and read-back.

Resolve the Slack, GitHub, Sentry, and first-party Analytics error action
schemas once and reuse them.

For every Slack write: use the exact parent `thread_ts` from a full-thread
read, never a search-result or adjacent timestamp, and re-read after posting.
Do not close, label, or assign GitHub/Sentry items, or post unrelated comments,
unless the invocation authorizes it. For PR review feedback, first verify the
live PR author and follow `babysit-pr`: concise replies that disposition
feedback on the active user's own PR, including a recap for feedback found only
in a review body, need no extra authorization. On another person's PR, comment
only when the invocation explicitly authorizes comments on that exact PR;
otherwise draft the reply, leave the feedback unresolved, and link it in the
recap. This exception is only for PR review feedback, not proactive PR comments
or issue comments.

## Publishing

Use this worktree's branch. Batch fixes with one
`corepack pnpm ship:push -m "<specific fix>"`; each head reruns CI. Sync
`origin/main` only for GitHub conflicts; prefer normal merges on shared
branches. Behind/pending never justify syncing.

Use `/ship` for PR ownership, push, and merge checks. Never push to another
person's PR without explicit authorization for that exact PR in this request.
Push-only authorization means `ship_mode=ready-only`; merging requires separate
authorization for that PR. Without push authorization, hand off as pending.
Carry feedback evidence and dispositions into PRs; reference only issues the
PR fixes.
Keep source-tested, built, deployed, and observed-live claims separate.

Carry exact tracker row ids and the reproduction ledger into the PR or release
recap; tracker status is not shipping evidence. Mark each row independently: a
reaction, checkmark, or "reviewed" cannot cover multiple rows, including
expected, docs-owned, cross-team, or duplicate items. Link each source/docs
change to its exact PR or commit, and each non-coding disposition to its
evidence or owner.

If no fix is verified, recap why shipping did not start. Unavailable connectors
and external failures are not shipping blockers.
While waiting, **Clarification needed** stays open with `👀` and no `✅`; it
must not block independent fixes unless it could affect a PR change. Later runs
skip the eye under the ownership gate.

## Recap

Every eligible item gets a row. Report gated skips by count only, without
message details.

`Open - no question` is a last resort, not a success state. It requires that
you worked the defect, could not fix it, and could not form a question that would
unblock it; a run whose ledger is mostly `Open - no question` has under-asked, not
finished. It keeps our eye and has no checkmark. "Nothing
matched" is valid only after each source was queried successfully, with the
cursor stated.
