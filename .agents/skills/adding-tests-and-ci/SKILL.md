# Adding Tests and CI

## Why this is a cost question

Every agent-native workflow draws on one org-wide pool of GitHub-hosted runners.
On the Team plan it held 60 concurrent jobs, and on 2026-09-29 the `Fast tests`
gate waited a median 445 s just for a slot. BuilderIO moved to Enterprise
Cloud in October 2026, which raises the pool to 500 jobs (50 macOS). Minutes
are free for this OSS repo; slots are shared with every private repo. Scope
still matters, because a job a change cannot affect delays other PRs once the
pool fills, but parallelism that cuts the critical path is now worth a slot.

`scripts/ci-change-scope.ts` is the one place that decides what a change runs.
It classifies the changed paths into a full or targeted run and emits one output
per check. `ci.yml` jobs gate on those outputs. A `.github/**` change, the
lockfile, root config, or a `scripts/**` change other than a guard script or
root script test forces a full run.

## Adding a test

- **Put it in the workspace of the code it proves.** Targeted runs test the
  changed packages and their dependents (`...{packages/core}`), so a test
  in another package either runs on unrelated changes or never runs on
  the one that breaks it.
- **Prove it at the cheapest tier that can fail for the bug:** a pure
  function, then a component or `.db.test.ts`, then browser E2E last.
  Some E2E suites, such as Design's, run only after merge and cannot fail
  a PR. Do not restate one assertion at several tiers.
  `design-editor-architecture` covers failing-first proof and mutation
  audits.
- **A new test joins an existing lane or job.** It never gets a job of its
  own. A changed root `scripts/*.test.ts`, or the test beside a changed
  guard script, runs in `Security guards` through the `script_tests`
  output.
- **Mind what `vitest --changed` cannot see.** Targeted Core lanes run only
  the tests whose import graph reaches a changed file. A test that reads a
  file from disk (a skill, a fixture, a template) will not rerun when only
  that file changes. Import it, or teach `requiresFullCoreFastTests` in
  `scripts/ci-test-lanes.ts` about the path.
- Never skip, disable, or quarantine a test to get green.

## Test workers

Fast-test lanes run Vitest with `VITEST_CONCURRENCY=100%`, one worker per
core. The shared config's 25% default is for laptops, and on CI's 4-vCPU
runners it meant one worker: a core shard took 542 s at one worker and 201 s
at four, on the same CPU time. On the 60-slot pool that let two full-width
lanes replace five, but each lane then ran ~18 min of packages one after
another. With 500 slots CI plans eight lanes (`LANES` in `ci.yml`): each costs
~100 s of setup, and the planner balances lanes by test-file count.

- **Large packages are sharded too.** `splitLargePackages` in
  `scripts/ci-test-lanes.ts` splits a package heavier than a fair lane share
  into Vitest `--shard`s, so Design no longer sets the floor for every lane.
  Only a bare `vitest` test script can be sharded, and no shard drops below
  `MIN_SHARD_FILES`.

- **Let CI override the worker count.** A package that pins `maxWorkers`
  goes through `resolveMaxWorkers(process.env, fallback)`; a literal
  overrides the CI setting.
- **Leave headroom for work inside a test body.** Booting PGlite or
  importing a server bundle takes several times longer when every core is
  busy, and a different test crosses the limit each run. The shared config
  allows 30 s; do not add a stricter per-block timeout.
- **Give parallel workers separate databases.** A file that opens the
  database without `DATABASE_URL` gets the default directory, whose lock
  admits one process at a time. Core's Vitest setup gives each worker slot
  its own under a root that belongs to one run, so concurrent runs never
  share one; a test that asserts the default URL clears `DATABASE_URL`
  itself.
- **Keep the forks pool with isolation.** Threads ran slower and failed 79
  tests; turning isolation off gained 7% and failed 129.

## Adding or changing a CI job

| Rule | Why, from this repo |
|---|---|
| Give a job its own check in `CHECK_NAMES` whose condition names the paths that can change its result. Never borrow another job's output. | The Postgres connection budget reused `neon_query_budget` and ran on every template edit. Its probe imports only `@agent-native/core/db`. |
| Per-app work takes a list output, not a boolean. Shared packages or a full run select every app; a template change selects that template; an empty selection turns the check off. If the check is on and the list is empty, the job fails. | `query_budget_apps` and `ssr_boot_apps`: a one-template PR built and measured all 16 templates (12–13 min). When shared code selects every template, `query_budget_matrix` splits them across two jobs. The beta publisher's `discover-sites` publishes only sites whose dependency closure changed. |
| Split the expensive step from the cheap one. Keep the cheap check on every run and gate the expensive step on its narrower inputs. | Android: `expo export` runs whenever a file Metro bundles changes, but the Gradle compile, the bulk of the ~23 min Android job, runs only when `packages/mobile-app`, the lockfile, or the workflow changed. |
| A path filter covers the job's whole dependency closure, including install-time inputs: root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the prebuild script, and the lockfile. | The desktop canary filter missed the bundled Chrome extension and then the postinstall inputs. Each gap skipped runs that should have caught a break. `guard:mobile-build-paths` traces Metro's imports and fails when the mobile filter misses one. |
| Subscribe only to events that can change the outcome. Validators pin some trigger sets, e.g. `scripts/validate-*-workflow.ts` and `scripts/package-release-workflow.test.ts`; update them in the same change. | Content product conformance reran on `labeled`/`unlabeled` but never reads labels, and on title edits although it reads the body only for its declaration. |
| Do not add a job for under a minute of work. Checkout, install, and a pool slot cost more than the check. Fold it into a job with the same setup, and do not duplicate what `pnpm guards` already runs. | Consolidation took PR pushes from ~31 to ~23 jobs. It folded PGlite locking into Content DB tests, privacy evals into Brain evals, QA static into Security guards, and the changeset check into Lint & format, and dropped a drizzle guard job `pnpm guards` covered. |
| Batch periodic publishing on a schedule with change detection, instead of once per merge. | Nightly npm snapshots publish every 3 h, and only when a publishable path changed since the last successful scheduled run. |
| PR workflows cancel superseded runs: `group: <name>-${{ github.event.pull_request.number \|\| github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: true`. Publishers on `main` use `cancel-in-progress: false` so a deploy is never killed mid-flight. An event rejected only by a job `if` still joins the run's group and cancels a real run, so filter it in `on:` or give ignored events a throwaway group. | Visual Recap events the gate ignored used to cancel an in-progress recap; they now get a throwaway group. |
| When scope cannot be computed, run everything or fail. Never skip. | An unreadable beta site list, an unknown base, or unrelated history publishes every site. A failed `git diff` fails the step; it is never `\|\| true`. |
| Print what fails, not everything. | The full-tree lint printed ~15k pre-existing warnings over the one error. It now runs `oxlint --quiet`. |

A skipped job counts as passing for required checks, so gating a required job
or step with `if` is safe. Every uppercase key a workflow adds under `env:`
needs a `docs/environment-variables.md` row (`guard:env-documentation`). Prefer
built-in `GITHUB_*` variables over new ones.

## Proving a CI change

- **Classifier:** add `scripts/ci-change-scope.test.ts` cases for each new
  check: on, off, full run, and tooling-only full run. Then run
  `node --experimental-strip-types --test scripts/ci-change-scope.test.ts scripts/ci-build-workspaces.test.ts scripts/ci-test-lanes.test.ts`.
- **Real history:** run `scripts/ci-change-scope.ts` with `GITHUB_OUTPUT` set
  on real `main` commit ranges, and put the before/after in the PR.
- **Shell:** run each new `run:` snippet locally against a matching input
  and an empty one. Run `actionlint` on the workflow when it is available.
- **Mind the self-test gap:** a PR that edits `ci.yml` runs full CI itself,
  so its own checks cannot show the saving. The classifier output is the
  evidence.

## Real failures this replaces

- "whats up with Cold-request query budget. runs on every CI for every
  template? seems wrong"
- "fast lane tests seem absuredly expensive"
- "why is Generate + run standalone Chat running so frequently? shouldnt it
  listen to Chat changes?"
- "so tldr: ~2-3 simultaneous PRs will eat up our entire quota of jobs right"
- "can you make lint & format not print all the warnings?"
