# Clips — Agent Guide

Clips records screens and meetings, manages transcripts, dictation, editing, and video sharing through shared SQL state and actions.

Use local docs only (no web research): `pnpm action docs-search --query "<topic>"` and `pnpm action docs-search --slug "<slug>"`.

## Core rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Use actions for recording metadata, transcripts, cleanup, chapters, comments, meetings, folders, sharing, and collaboration. Respect access helpers. Keep large media/blob payloads out of SQL, state, settings, and resources; store bytes in configured storage and persist references.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog first; reuse its scoped resolver. Never hardcode credentials, webhook URLs, private/customer data, or credential-like literals.
- Recording start/stop/pause are browser gestures requiring user activation; navigate to the recording view instead of using a server action. Prefer native transcripts; cloud transcription is fallback-only. Do not hide a usable transcript after failed metadata work.
- Use `import-loom-recording` for Loom or direct MP4/WebM URLs. Loom/public transcripts import in the background; request a transcript afterward for direct video. Transactional email claims two-Clip summary work and ends in one sentence.
- `view-screen` may return a transcript preview truncated mid-sentence without an ending marker. When `previewTruncated`, read `get-recording-player-data` before judging completeness or quoting.
- Clips are unlisted-by-link, not searchable. Only inspect recordings the user owns, viewed, or identified by URL/id. Never use `list-recordings` / `search-recordings` to find another person's clip, answer a date question, or recover a failed lookup; report the failure.
- Sharing actions control access; passwords/expiry only tighten it. Screen Memory is local-only, disabled by default, and never hosted or shareable.
- Never fabricate. Read via actions, verify writes by read-back, and refresh after writes. Use `view-screen` when recording, transcript segment, meeting, or share context is unclear.

## Application state

- `navigation` tracks library, shared-with-me, recording, share, meeting, dictation, settings, and transcript context. A recording includes focused `panel` and requested `atMs`; `navigate` opens that viewer context.
- `selection` holds selected recording ids in selection mode. `recording-setup.import` holds the Loom-import UI state, never the pasted URL. `record-intent` is a UI-consumed capture request and is then cleared.

## Key actions

Use `tool-search` for the full surface, including screen-memory.
