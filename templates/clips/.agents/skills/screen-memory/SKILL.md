# Screen Memory

## Rule

Screen Memory is a disabled-by-default, local-only desktop buffer of recent
screen, app, and window context. It is not a hosted Clips recording, and never
describe it as hosted, shared, exhaustive, or enabled by default.

## Reading it from the in-app agent

1. Call `get-screen-memory-status` before relying on it at all.
2. Then call `query-screen-memory-context` for bounded recent snippets when
   local context files are present.

If the local Screen Memory MCP built-in is connected, the agent may also use
`screen_memory_status`, `screen_memory_recent_context`, and
`screen_memory_recent_segments`. Only inspect or export segment file paths when
the user explicitly asks.

## User control and external agents

Users enable, pause, export, and clear the buffer from the desktop tray
settings. External local agents can read recent app/window context through
`agent-native mcp screen-memory`.

Do not upload raw Screen Memory segments or treat them as shareable Clips unless
the user explicitly exports and imports them.

## Earlier screen time (lab)

Behind the `clips.lookback-context` lab (`CLIPS_LOOKBACK_CONTEXT`, off by
default). When the lab is off, do not offer this feature.

This is not Screen Memory. It is passive metadata on one clip: screen history
from before that recording started, attached to the clip as its own context.
The window is never stitched into the clip's video, and the clip's video is
unchanged.

An item has two windows, both inside the 5 minutes before the recording
started:

- The original window (`originalStartedAt` / `originalEndedAt`) is the widest
  allowed, the last 5 minutes. It is fixed when the item is requested.
- The current window (`startedAt` / `endedAt`) is the part the owner selected.
  It starts as the last `requestedSeconds` (1 to 300) before the recording
  started. Any window inside the original, at least 1 second long, is allowed.

It is private with its clip. Requesting it makes the clip private, and it is
refused while the clip still has direct shares. While an item is active, sharing
the clip is refused: making it public or visible to the organization, or
granting access, fails until the item is removed. Never describe it as
shareable. The request's `endedAt` must be within 120 seconds of the clip's
start, or it fails with `recording_context_invalid_window`.

The footage is a separate private recording, uploaded from this device through
the Rewind handoff. Its source app name is `Clips Rewind`; the footage check
refuses any other recording. The export handshake goes through
`update-recording-context`: `processing` claims the item and may name the
footage recording it created (`mediaRecordingId`); `ready` must name that same
recording, or it fails with `recording_context_footage_mismatch`; `failed`
releases the claim's footage. Changing the window returns the item to `pending`
and releases any reservation, and the desktop re-exports and uploads only the
new window. Removing the item trashes that footage recording and any footage an
export is still reserving.

The desktop editor builds a local preview of the original window with the
`rewind_preview_window` Tauri command, and deletes it with
`rewind_preview_discard`. The preview is never uploaded, and no action exposes
it.

On the web, the clip's Transcript tab shows the context above the transcript
when the lab is on and the clip has an item. Editing happens in the desktop app.

Read it with:

- `list-recording-context` (viewer access) returns the clip's active item: its
  window, `status` (`pending`, `processing`, `ready`, or `failed`), and any
  error. Removed items are excluded. Only a `ready` item has footage.
- `list-pending-recording-context` is for the desktop export worker, not for
  answering questions. It lists pending requests on clips the signed-in user
  owns. Pass `excludeIds[]` for items this device cannot process, so they do
  not hold up the batch.

Writes are owner-only: `request-recording-context`,
`update-recording-context`, `set-recording-context-window`, and
`remove-recording-context`. The desktop worker drives exports and status
changes. Change the window or remove the context only when the owner asks.
