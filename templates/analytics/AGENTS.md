# Analytics — Agent Guide

Analytics owns sources, queries, charts, and dashboards; dashboards are canonical and legacy analyses remain readable.

## Skills

The skills summary lists every skill; find more with `rg --hidden --follow` in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and read one with `pnpm action docs-search --slug "skill-<name>"` before deeper work.

Use local docs only (no web research): `pnpm action docs-search --query "<topic>"` and `pnpm action docs-search --slug "<slug>"`. Source examples: `pnpm action source-search --query "<pattern>"` or `pnpm action source-search --path <path>`.

## Data questions

- Edit a panel on the open dashboard with `get-sql-dashboard` (`panelIds`), then `mutate-dashboard`; no skill read is needed (read `dashboard-management` to create a dashboard or move, reorder, or lay out panels). A dashboard edit is done only when `mutate-dashboard` returns `verified: true`. `noRenderAffected: true` means no chart changed. On `verified: false`, an error, or "the change isn't visible", follow `nextStep` and call `inspect-dashboard-panel` before saying anything; "Applied N ops", a raw `bigquery` result, or no warning banner is not proof.
- Start from the closest query example (a preloaded reference, else one `find-data` search); to build or clone a dashboard from another, call `search-dashboard-references`, then inspect matches with `get-sql-dashboard` or `get-explorer-dashboard` by `kind`. A match is context, not live data.
- Use one bounded SQL or server-side `run-code` call for lists, filters, counts, or cohorts. If the catalog misses, call `find-data` once, then inspect exact metadata with `search-bigquery-schema` or provider status only when needed; do not fan out per item or add unasked breakdowns.
- For an exact owner-defined dbt metric, use `query-dbt-semantic-metric` when a dbt workspace connection is available. dbt defines metric meaning and grain; Sigma and Amplitude are examples and cross-checks. Do not infer an owner-approved metric from a model name or dashboard.
- Give a concise, evidence-backed answer with source, window, filters, sample size, join method, and caveats. Label figures “Unverified” if no live query ran; never cite the public `demo` source as real evidence unless asked.
- Create or change saved artifacts only when asked. For named accounts, use `account-deep-dive`; for health, read `account-health`. When challenged on coverage, rerun from the source cohort and provide the updated answer.

## Core rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Sibling apps delegate metrics and product questions over A2A in natural language, never SQL. Analytics owns schema, source selection, and stable shaped reads.
- Use actions for data and sharing; respect ownable access checks. Provider actions are shortcuts: for broad/absence-sensitive Gong work stage and reduce raw data with `query-staged-dataset` or a Data Program.
- Reports/alerts use SQL actions and cap at five recipients. Store large payloads in file/blob storage, not SQL or app state.
- Never invent data or source semantics. For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog first; reuse its scoped resolver.
- For MCP, use allowlisted cataloged actions; use `ask_app` for interpretation, source selection, multi-step, or unsupported actions.
- Replay-key MCP write: `update-analytics-public-key` appends origins; the first origin restricts replay.

## Sessions and state

- `list-session-recordings` filters scoped replays. Use `paginated: true` for sorted pages with a real total and app counts. With the Sessions triage Lab, `didEvents` / `didNotEvents` filter tracked events and `slow` filters speed. Get names/counts from `list-session-event-names` and event health from `list-event-catalog`; Analytics' index covers sessions only since its coverage start. Never query BigQuery for these views.
- `navigation` tracks dashboard, analysis, source, chart, and selection. `navigate` opens supported Analytics views, including `sessions`, `event-catalog`, `performance`, `monitoring`, and `agents`. Use `view-screen` when context is unclear.
- Clicking a panel stages a chat context chip and sets `selected-object` with `type="dashboard-panel"`; read `dashboard-management` for dashboard overview/folder actions.

Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit`; for supported customization, read `customizing-agent-native`.
