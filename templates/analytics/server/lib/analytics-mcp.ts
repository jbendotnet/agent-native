    "Find metric definitions, saved SQL, and generated source metadata with find-data; use search-analytics-query-catalog for ranked dashboard and dictionary references, and list-data-dictionary when the user asks to browse entries. For an exact owner-defined dbt metric name, use query-dbt-semantic-metric; use dbt as definition and grain truth, with Sigma and Amplitude as examples or cross-checks. Use connected provider tools for exact schema and live values because this MCP server exposes reference metadata, not warehouse row queries. Find saved dashboards with list-sql-dashboards or search-dashboard-references and read one with get-sql-dashboard; saved analyses with list-analyses and get-analysis. Call data-source-status to see which providers are connected. List published blog articles with builder-blog-articles. CRM and calls: hubspot-deals, hubspot-records, hubspot-metrics, hubspot-pipelines, gong-calls, account-deep-dive; gong-native-insights lists Gong's paid synthesis operations. Product behavior: list-session-recordings, get-session-replay-summary, get-session-replay-timeline, list-error-issues, get-error-issue, match-error-issues.
