/**
 * Server-serving duty: the process-local claim that a real Nitro server
 * instance has booted and is wiring its H3 app for real requests, plus the
 * build-time proof that the code running is a production server bundle.
 *
 * Netlify/Lambda/Vercel each hand the process a platform env var that is only
 * ever set during a real function invocation, never during a build. Bare
 * Node/Docker has no such var, and `NODE_ENV` cannot stand in for one: build
 * steps set `NODE_ENV=production` too, while `node .output/server/index.mjs`
 * and `agent-native start` run without it. The two signals here replace it.
 *
 * The serving flag is set from
 * {@link import("../server/framework-request-handler.js").getH3App}, the one
 * choke point every plugin — default or app-authored, on every preset —
 * calls to register routes, the first time any nitroApp instance actually
 * boots. A build never constructs a real nitroApp, so it never fires there.
 * It does fire for `pnpm dev` and test suites that boot an H3 app, which is
 * why it only counts together with {@link isProductionServerBuild}.
 *
 * Its own module, mirroring `./migration-runtime.js`: `client.js` reads it,
 * and keeping it out of `client.js` avoids adding one more stub to every
 * `vi.mock("../db/client.js")` in the codebase.
