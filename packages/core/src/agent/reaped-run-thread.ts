 * saves its own. That worker held the reply only in memory, so without this
 * the turn's finished tool calls exist only in the run ledger, which is
 * pruned, and the thread forgets an email already went out.
 *
 * A run continued in its turn is saved as the first part of that turn's
 * reply; one with nothing after it keeps its error. Nothing is saved once a
 * later turn started or a later prompt was saved, because the reply would
 * land under that prompt instead of its own.
