 * SECURITY — these values are interpolated into the sandboxed extension
 * iframe's Content-Security-Policy. A source expression is validated as a
 * single token with no whitespace or `;`, so a configured value can extend
 * `img-src` / `media-src` but can never terminate the directive and append a
 * new one. `connect-src` is not configurable and stays `'self'`. A remote
 * `img-src` / `media-src` origin is still an explicit egress permission:
 * the browser requests that URL, so extension script can encode data into
 * it. The host bridge is the permission-gated path for API calls, not a
 * claim that these sources are egress-free.
