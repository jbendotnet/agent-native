/**
 * The app resource change feed: a durable note that one of an app's
 * resources changed, kept once for every consumer that asked to hear about
 * that resource type.
 *
 * Producers call one SQL function, `agent_native_app_resource_changed`, in the
 * writer's own transaction, so nothing is recorded unless the write commits.
 * Today the producers are row triggers that core generates for a registered
 * table. They catch every writer: actions, sync jobs, raw SQL, and deletes.
 * If core later gains a data layer that every write goes through, it calls the
 * same function and the triggers retire; consumers don't change.
 *
 * Each (consumer, resource) pair is one row. Repeated changes update that row
 * rather than adding rows, so autosave doesn't grow the feed. Every change
 * takes a new value from one sequence, taken after the row lock, so for any
 * one resource a larger `seq` always means a later committed change. Consumers
 * use it to reject stale work and to delete only what they processed.
 *
 * A change that fails is retried with backoff, and after its last allowed
 * attempt it is marked failed but still retried every few minutes. It stays
 * pending the whole time, so a consumer that reports freshness never treats
 * it as done.
 *
 * Consumers never poll. They process changes only where the database is
 * already awake: before a read that needs fresh data, right after a write, or
 * inside the framework's recurring sweep. See docs/search-architecture.md.
